# Hello, Connections!!
I am here to share my First Hands-On Experience with Power BI. I would be grateful for any feedback or recommendations from you all. Your suggestions will help me improve for future projects.

As a data enthusiast and a FIFA fan, I was excited to get my hands on the FIFA18 dataset and explore it with Power BI.

First, I want to thank AlmaBetter for providing me with the dataset and the opportunity. I imported the data into Power BI and started exploring it.

Next, I created a few visualizations to explore the data. One of the most interesting insights I uncovered was the comparison of each Club's Player Potential with their respective Ratings (overall). I created a Line chart to highlight the comparison, and it was evident that the majority of the players had greater Potential than their respective Ratings, particularly the young players aged 20-30. Also, it was evident that most Clubs are investing in players with greater potential rather than just overall ratings.

Another interesting insight I found was the distribution of player nationalities in the game. Finally, I created a dashboard that combined all the visualizations I created and added some filters to make it interactive. The dashboard allowed me to explore the data in more detail and gain more insights.

Overall, my first hands-on experience with Power BI on the FIFA18 dataset was a great learning experience. Power BI is a powerful tool that can help you gain insights from your data and present it in a visually appealing way. I am excited to continue exploring the FIFA18 dataset and other datasets with Power BI in the future.
